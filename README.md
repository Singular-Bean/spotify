# Spotify liked song utils

To run, make sure you have installed nodejs ([download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)), then use:

```
node index.mjs [command]
```

Where `[command]` is one of:

```
download-liked-songs    Download all liked songs (run this first)
most-popular            Finds the most popular track in your liked songs
```

To add new commands, simply add a file in `src`, eg. `my-command.mjs`.
